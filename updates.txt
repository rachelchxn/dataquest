trouble with categorical data
month and date variables into day of the year

tried dropping categorical features
    bookingID should be removed

turn mealplan, RoomType, MarketSegment divided into dummy categories

combined weekend and weekday nights

total prev bookings = canceled + non canceled

total guests = adults + NumChildren

total price = avg price * days
